	abstract = {With the implement of China's ex-situ poverty alleviation resettlement (ESPAR) policy, nearly 10 million rural population have relocated with a better living condition in a short period of time, most of which have migrated to urban areas. The living environment and lifestyle of the poverty alleviation migrants (PAMs) have undergone dramatic changes, the resulting mental health problems may seriously affect their social integration and well-being. In particular, homesickness is a prevalent mental problem among the PAMs that demand prompt attention. Research indicates that longing for natural environment is one of the major causes of homesickness among rural out-migrants. As the main natural environment in cities, urban green space has been proven by numerous studies to have a positive effect on residents' mental health in various aspects, including reducing anxiety, relieving fatigue, and fostering perseverance. However, few studies have focused on the influence of urban green space on the mental health of the PAMs, especially on alleviating their homesickness syndrome. Using the data collected from interviews and questionnaire survey in the PAMs’ resettlement sites in Anshun, Guizhou, which has undertaken a heavy poverty alleviation task, this study examined the relationship between the physical activity, environment, function of urban green space, and the severity of PAMs’ homesickness, meanwhile paying attention to the impacts caused by different socio-demographic characteristics. The results show that urban green space is strongly associated with alleviating PAMs’ homesickness, and that all three factors play a positive role. Neighborhood green space is used the most, but suburban green space seems to provide better alleviation of homesickness. This study sheds lights on the critical role of urban green space for promoting PAMs' mental health, and aims to provide scientific reference to the planning and improvement for future migrant resettlements and urban green space.},

	abstract = {Despite the fact that Europe is becoming more ethnically diverse, little is known about the outdoor recreation habits of non-Western immigrants in Europe. North American research has shown that there are major differences in the use, preferences and motivation for outdoor recreation of immigrants and their descendants compared to the mainstream white population in North America. Knowledge about the use and needs for outdoor recreation among different user groups can provide useful information for managers, planners and policy-makers in the field of landscape management and integration, because they have to meet the needs of an increasingly multicultural citizenry. This article reviews the literature in the field of outdoor recreation and ethnicity in Europe, identifies research gaps, and discusses implications for future research. We can identify an emerging field of study on ethnicity and outdoor recreation in Europe: the vast majority of the studies have focused on ethnic minorities in parks and urban forests in European cities, while there are few studies of ethnic minority recreational behaviour in areas outside cities. Topics such as leisure activities, outdoor recreation patterns, access and distance to green space, and non-Western immigrants’ perception of nature have been investigated. However, the results are difficult to compare, because the researchers have employed different methods and have used differing categories to distinguish ethnic affiliation. Therefore, this study has several implications for future research: (1) European scholars need to become more sensitive towards ethnic affiliation; the in-group heterogeneity of the ethnic minorities has to be taken into account. (2) Future research should examine areas other than urban areas, and we need to take more account of the motives for participating in outdoor recreation. (3) Furthermore, investigation of the influence of acculturation on ethnic minorities’ outdoor recreation pattern would provide a more comprehensive picture.},

BME groups in the UK suffer from poorer health and a wide range of environmental inequalities that include poorer access to urban green space and poorer quality of green space provision. This study used a household questionnaire (n = 523) to explore the relationship between general health and a range of individual, social and physical environmental predictors in deprived white British and BME groups living in ethnically diverse cities in England. Results from Chi-Squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) segmentation analyses identified three distinct general health segments in our sample ranging from “very good” health (people of Indian origin), to ”good” health (white British), and ”poor” health (people of African-Caribbean, Bangladeshi, Pakistani origin and other BME groups), labelled ”Mixed BME” in the analyses. Correlated Component Regression analyses explored predictors of general health for each group. Common predictors of general health across all groups were age, disability, and levels of physical activity. However, social and environmental predictors of general health-including use and perceptions of urban green space-varied among the three groups. For white British people, social characteristics of place (i.e., place belonging, levels of neighbourhood trust, loneliness) ranked most highly as predictors of general health, whilst the quality of, access to and the use of urban green space was a significant predictor of general health for the poorest health group only, i.e., in ”Mixed BME”. Results are discussed from the perspective of differences in use and perceptions of urban green space amongst ethnic groups. We conclude that health and recreation policy in the UK needs to give greater attention to the provision of local green space amongst poor BME communities since this can play an important role in helping address the health inequalities experienced by these groups.},

In particular, the importance of memory and nostalgia in participants’ experiences; the significance of plants; the novelty of visiting British ‘parks’; and the role of greenspace in enhancing the quality of life of immigrants are explored. The paper concludes that a positive impression of the local environment and meaning-ful participation in it can be a useful component of integration into a new society. Furthermore, recognition of landscape elements or characteristics can provide a conceptual link between former and new homes. However, for this refugee group many physical and psychological barriers must be overcome if the full benefits of urban public open space are to be realised.},

It builds on previous research, which has highlighted the potential for green space interaction for supporting positive emotional and mental wellbeing, particularly in times of stress and uncertainty. Using this basis, the paper explores whether UGS interaction also helped to mitigate the negative mental health impacts brought about by the first COVID-19 lockdown. The specific focus is on students and expatriates living in Berlin, Germany as this population groupbecame increasingly vulnerable during this time as a result of uncertainty and restrictions in their daily lives brought about the enforced lockdown measures. More specifically, this paper investigates how a change in their daily routines created opportunities to interact with and experience UGS differently and how their emotional response and perception towards these spaces changed. Semi-structured interviews allowed for stories, experiences and emotions to unfold, which revealed that the participants’ gained an appreciation for the potential of UGS to support their wellbeing during a stressful and isolating time. UGS interaction also allowed them to form tangible memories of summer 2020 as it provided a safe arena for them to maintain social contact with friends outdoors, or to escape their home environment and experience respite and relaxation in a natural setting. The findings demonstrate that for this sub-group of the population UGS became a reliable constant and a valuable public health resource, which may also help to mitigate the long-term adverse mental health impacts of the pandemic.},

Relying on in-depth interviews with key participants, the paper analyses how Bonaire stakeholders attempted to pursue both economic and ecological approaches to sustainability by combining these three. It also examines why this effort has not yet been successful, an examination that emphasises a decline in tourist demand and an approach to collaboration that was unsystematic and lacking in institutionalised structure. Implications for collaboration theory include the findings that there is vulnerability in informal modes of organisation and that progress from one stage of deliberation to the next does not necessarily require closure at the earlier stage. Implications for sustainable tourism include the confirmation of hypotheses concerning the critical role played by economies of scale and policy interdependence.},

This article examines the analytical potential of actor-network theory (ANT) to study eco-innovation. ANT assumes that reality consists of actor-networks made of human and non-human elements that perform actors as network effects. We argue that, in a time when climate change is the simultaneous product and producer of human actions, eco-innovation is better understood when research gives the human and non-human elements that perform eco-innovations equal analytical treatment. We therefore develop an ANT-inspired framework, which we apply in a case study to investigate the development of a specific eco-innovation: CARMACAL, a web-based carbon management application in the Dutch travel industry. We find that technological novelty alone is insufficient to instigate transition. CARMACAL affords multiple new practices with opposite implications for socio-economic and environmental sustainability. The practices triggering most industry support are least effective in addressing tourism's climate impacts and vice versa. Examining eco-innovation through ANT helps us put eco-innovation in a different light. Seemingly contradictory practices may be mutually supportive: their individual strengths and weaknesses may help prevent the failure of eco-innovations. This new possibility opens the way for concerted policies strengthening the contribution of eco-innovations to sustainability transitions.},

Its contribution is a critical conceptualization of how collaborative tourism design can facilitate sustainable transformation. Recognizing SDG \#17 to “Revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development” we argue that collaboration – not only partnerships and cooperation – should be a central tenet for intentional change. Collaboration rests on the hypothesis that the sum is more than its individual parts. We introduce how the collaborative design (co-design) of tourism contributes a unique range of processes, methods, tools and notably an attitude of mind that enables its practitioners to, with others, explore, reveal, encompass and address issues and nuances in an overall sustainable tourism co-design process. This understanding deliberately challenges the notion that a sustainable development process can be planned and micro-managed with pre-determined outcomes. Examples from Denmark and Norway illustrate how sustainable tourism co-design intentionally aims to transform human relations, encourage stewardship and demonstrate how such a practice does not reach for quick-fix solutions. Findings indicate that we have yet to realize the power of collaboration, stewardship and “other-regarding” ethics to guide actions underpinning SDG\#17 for more sustainable and resourceful futures.},

The study explored the various collaborative marketing approaches shaped by diverse stakeholders’ perspectives on ways to achieve the sustainable development of CBTEs in Vietnam. The results of 30 in-depth, semi-structured interviews from three CBTEs in Vietnam showed that three collaborative marketing approaches were prevailed among CBTE stakeholders and were categorised as commercial viability-driven, community development-driven and balanced approaches. The approaches’ differences were reflected in the marketing objectives to achieve CBTE sustainability, the central linkages of CBTE collaborative marketing, and the facilitators of stakeholder collaboration. The research found a knowledge gap between researchers and research participants and divergent perspectives among different categories of research participants regarding marketing and CBTE sustainability. This paper implies the role of a knowledge co-production approach to drive the stakeholder engagement in CBTE collaborative marketing for CBTEs’ long-term success. Additionally, this study provides insights into the discussion of marketing for sustainable tourism. Furthermore, the findings contribute to a better understanding of the collaborative approach at the organisational level.},

	abstract = {Tourism is one of most perspective and dynamic businesses in the world. It is of great significance to plan and develop tourism purposefully and sustainably though the search for compromises between environmental, economic and social aims of society. The sustainable tourism development management has to retain high satisfaction degree of tourists' needs, assure significant experience for consumers, increasing their consciousness under issues of sustainability, and propagating practices of sustainable tourism among them. The significance of sustainable tourism sector development ambition is analysed in this paper through the lens of strengthening its competitiveness. The paper analyses scientific literature and seeks to discover the main forms and factors for the strengthening of the tourism competitiveness by implementing economic, social and environmental targets of tourism destination territories development. The broad systematic literature review provided for some interesting findings: The business participants are interested in the implementation of new technologies in tourism services having positive impact on environment and local communities; however, a lot of challenges exist how to change environment, increase of consumers' motivations for sustainable tourism services and to change their behaviour towards more sustainable one. The current Covid 19 outbreak and high risks of future pandemics have risen new challenges for sustainable tourism development. In this paper the main sustainable tourist development challenges are addressed and new insights for the strengthening of competitiveness of sustainable tourism destination are provided. The future research guidelines are set based on analysis performed.

	abstract = {This article analyses the use of mixed methods in papers published in the Journal of Sustainable Tourism over the 10 years, 2005–2014. First, a content analysis of the articles shows that mixed methods are used primarily for expansion and development of results, and less often for triangulation or complementarity. Sequential designs are slightly more popular than simultaneous designs, with qualitative research preceding the quantitative element. In the majority of cases, both the quantitative and qualitative methods have equivalent importance, yet where one is dominant, this is usually the quantitative part. Second, we contextualise the content analysis by exemplifying the use of mixed methods in selected papers, using commentary from authors who have recently published mixed methods papers. We reflect on the reasons for, strengths and weaknesses of using mixed methods, and we argue that mixed methods provide sustainable tourism academics with more opportunities for pragmatic transformative research for societal change, and increasing research reliability in relation to social desirability bias, stakeholder comparisons and transdisciplinarity. The paper notes the need for greater understanding of mixed methods by researchers, its special value and growing importance in sustainable tourism research, and its challenges and strengths for authors and editors.},

Thirteen independent variables are used to measure various economic, social and demographic influences on small island migration patterns. Two profiles are constructed contrasting the characteristics and behaviour of twenty three immigrant and nineteen emigrant islands. The former are found to be more affluent than their emigrant counterparts with higher per capita income and lower unemployment. They also exhibit lower infant mortality, fertility and greater progress through the demographic transition. Immigrant islands are also characterised by dependent political status and the assumed favourable advantages of substantial trade, investment and tourism linkages with their patron countries. Finally, a provisional multivariate model is developed that suggests a combination of determinants account for most of the variation in island migration. They include per capita income, working-age population, literacy and political status.},

Statistics Canada data show that from 2001 to 2006, there was a net out-migration from the Strait Region to other areas in Canada. This was a continuance of a pattern established nearly two decades ago. This, coupled with an aging population, means that the economic viability and social vitality of the Strait Region is being slowly undermined. The decline in the population of rural and small town settlements over the past two decades has negative implications for the local economy, families and communities, and community support structures in the Strait Region. We conclude by arguing that more resources are needed for the retention of immigrants if some of the negative consequences of out-migration (such as labour market shortages) are to be redressed.

	abstract = {Migration is not only transforming sending, transit, and receiving countries, but also social scientific studies. The expansions of human mobility, profound demographic transformations, and their diverse social, political and economic consequences have brought unprecedented theoretical and empirical attention to the phenomenon. While migration research has relatively longer and more established tradition in US academia, its growth in European scholarship in the last three decades has been remarkable. An increasing number of scholars and journals devote their work to understanding causes and consequences, current situations, changes and continuities of migration-related issues in Europe. Moreover, the expansion of research centres and networks, undergraduate and graduate programs, conference meetings, winter and summer schools demonstrate increasing institutional visibility of migration research. For instance, IMISCOE (International Migration, Integration, and Social Cohesion), which is currently Europe’s largest network of scholars in the area of migration and integration, has grown from 19 founding member institutes in 2004 (Brus 2014) to 39 member institutes in 2017 and over 500 individual members. On the other hand, what is less evident is the systematic attention to the methodological issues in European migration studies. This edited volume presents an effort to address this gap, through the collaboration of migration scholars from diverse disciplines. It is a unique volume as it brings together a multidisciplinary perspective as well as illustrations of different issues derived from the research experience of the recognized authors.},

It is a scoping review that maps current ethical challenges that migration scholars often face and provide guidance, while acknowledging the fact that many researchers deal with ethical issues on a case-by-case basis. Design/methodology/approach By connecting three lines of debates – ethics in social sciences, in qualitative research and in migration studies – this article addresses the following core questions: What are the particular ethical dilemmas in qualitative migration research (QMR)? How do migration researchers deal with these ethical dilemmas? What is the role of universal ethical codes of conduct and case-by-case ethical considerations in dealing with particular situations? Findings This review demonstrates that special aspects of migration research context, e.g. participants' mobility, potential vulnerability and migration as a politicized issue as well as the flexible and exploratory nature of qualitative research require particular ethical awareness that cannot be sufficiently addressed by standardized guidelines. Originality/value It proposes that efforts to raise ethical awareness must go beyond researchers' ethical confessions or blind adherence to pre-fixed guidance. Researchers must have critical “ethical radar” before, during and after their fieldwork; not only while working on extreme and vulnerable cases but also while doing all kind of research regardless of the level of vulnerability. Last but not least, this article claims the need for including critical ethical consciousness substantially in higher education programmes at the very beginning of the research career.},

The questions raised are focusing on their experiences as migrant/minority researchers, with particular emphasis placed on gender and on the potential of a reflexive engagement with positionality to disrupt asymmetrical power relations in the field.

	title = {A {General} {Inductive} {Approach} for {Qualitative} {Data} {Analysis}},
	volume = {27},
	abstract = {An outline of a general inductive approach for qualitative data analysis is described and details provided about the assumptions and procedures used. The purposes for using an inductive approach are to (1) to condense extensive and varied raw text data into a brief, summary format; (2) to establish clear links between the research objectives and the summary findings derived from the raw data and (3) to develop of model or theory about the underlying structure of experiences or processes which are evident in the raw data. The inductive approach reflects frequently reported patterns used in qualitative data analysis. Most inductive studies report a model that has between three and eight main categories in the findings. The general inductive approach provides a convenient and efficient way of analysing qualitative data for many research purposes. The outcomes of analysis may be indistinguishable from those derived from a grounded theory approach. Many researchers are likely to find using a general inductive approach more straightforward than some of the other traditional approaches to qualitative data analysis. A general inductive approach for qualitative data analysis David R. Thomas, School of Population Health, University of Auckland, August 2003 2 A general inductive approach for qualitative data analysis There is a wide range of literature that documents the underlying assumptions and procedures associated with analysing qualitative data. Many of these are associated with specific approaches or traditions such as grounded theory (Strauss \& Corbin, 1990), phenomenology (e.g., van Manen, 1990), discourse analysis (e.g., Potter \& Wetherall, 1994) and narrative analysis (e.g., Leiblich, 1998). However some analytic approaches are "generic" and are not labelled within one of the specific traditions of qualitative research (e.g., Ezzy, 2002; Pope, Ziebland, \& Mays, 2000; Silverman, 2000). In working with researchers who adopt what has been described as a "critical realist" epistemology (Miles \& Huberman, 1994) the author has found that many researchers unfamiliar with any of the traditional approaches to qualitative analysis, wish to have a straightforward set of procedures to follow without having to learn the technical language or "jargon" associated with many of the traditional approaches. Often they find existing literature on qualitative data analysis too technical to understand and use. The present paper has evolved from the need to provide researchers analysing qualitative data with a brief, non-technical set of data analysis procedures. A considerable number of authors reporting analyses of qualitative data in journal articles (where space for methodological detail is often restricted) describe a strategy that can be labelled as a "general inductive approach." This strategy is evident in much qualitative data analysis (Bryman \& Burgess, 1994; Dey, 1993), often without an explicit label being given to the analysis strategy. The purpose of the present paper is to describe the key features evident in the general inductive approach and outline a set of procedures that can be used for the analysis of qualitative data. The inductive approach is a systematic procedure for analysing qualitative data where the analysis is guided by specific objectives.},

	abstract = {Rural tourism has long been considered a means of achieving economic and social development and regeneration. More specifically, it has been widely promoted as an effective source of income and employment, particularly in peripheral rural areas where traditional agrarian industries have declined. More recently, however, a number of established tourism destinations have also turned to rural tourism in order to diversify their tourism products and markets and to spread the benefits of tourism away from the coastal resorts into the hinterland. The purpose of this paper is to explore the extent to which this latter role for rural tourism represents a realistic tourism development policy. Based upon research into the development of ‘agrotourism’ in Cyprus, it highlights the challenges and problems encountered by rural tourism entrepreneurs, identifying a number of issues which militate against the success of rural tourism development. In particular, it identifies high development costs but low returns, low demand, a lack of essential skills and the dominance of mass tourism operators as major challenges. It concludes, therefore, long-term financial and technical support is essential if tourism is to play an effective rural development role.},

This chapter provides an overview of (1) urban green spaces; (2) the methods that are applied to characterize exposure to these spaces; (3) the potential mechanisms through which green spaces could exert their health effects; (4) the health effects associated with contact to green spaces; and (5) the role of socioeconomic status (SES) in such effects. To date, a range of methods including questionnaires, field surveys, GPS, remote-sensing data, and land cover/land use maps have been applied to characterise use of green spaces, access to these spaces, their amount in vicinity of participants living and/or working environments, and their quality. The mechanism underlying health effects of green spaces are yet to be established but stress reduction/cognitive restoration, mitigation of the exposure to air pollution, noise, and heat, enhancing social cohesion/interactions, increasing physical activity, and enriching micro- and macro-biodiversity and environmental microbial input have been suggested to be involved. Exposure to green spaces has been associated with, among others, improved perceived general health, better pregnancy outcomes (e.g. birth weight), enhanced brain development in children, better cognitive function in adults, improved mental health, lower risk of a number of chronic diseases (e.g. diabetes and cardiovascular conditions), and reduced mortality. Given the many benefits of green space, health of urban residents who often have limited access to these spaces can be improved by increasing the amount of green space.},

	abstract = {Objectives
Local availability of green space has been associated with a wide range of health benefits. Possible causative mechanisms underpinning the green space and health relationship include the provision of physical activity opportunities, the stress-relieving effects of nature and the facilitation of social contacts. This study sought to investigate whether urban green space was related to individual-level health outcomes, and whether levels of physical activity were likely to be a mediating factor in any relationships found.
Study design
Cross-sectional analysis of anonymized individual health survey responses.
Methods
Neighbourhood-level green space availability was linked to 8157 respondents to the New Zealand Health Survey 2006/07 on the basis of their place of residence. Adjusted multilevel models were constructed for four health outcomes which are plausibly related to green space via physical activity: cardiovascular disease; overweight; poor general health; and poor mental health (Short Form 36).
Results
The greenest neighbourhoods had the lowest risks of poor mental health [odds ratio (OR) 0.81, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.66–1.00]. Cardiovascular disease risk was reduced in all neighbourhoods with {\textgreater}15\% green space availability (e.g. OR 0.80, 95\% CI 0.64–0.99 for those with 33–70\% green space), However, a dose–response relationship was not found. Green space availability was not related to overweight or poor general health. Overall, levels of physical activity were higher in greener neighbourhoods, but adjustment for this only slightly attenuated the green space and health relationships.
Conclusions
Neighbourhood green space was related to better cardiovascular and mental health in a New Zealand Health Survey, independent of individual risk factors. Although physical activity was higher in greener neighbourhoods, it did not fully explain the green space and health relationship.},

However, lack of access to UGS or important features of UGS, in addition to concerns about UGS safety or maintenance, could prevent people from receiving these benefits. We designed an online survey to understand how people were using and perceiving UGS during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City during the spring of 2020. The survey included questions about how people’s visits to UGS and perceptions of the importance of UGS for their health had changed since the start of the pandemic, as well as the concerns people had and features of UGS they considered important. Of the 1372 people who took the survey, most respondents were concerned about a lack of social distancing and crowded UGS, and respondents with these concerns were less likely to visit UGS and had visited UGS less often during than before the pandemic. In addition, generalized linear models showed differences in some concerns and important features of UGS across gender, race and ethnicity, demonstrating the importance of considering specific community needs in UGS design and management. Although concerns about lack of access were not common in our study population, these also appeared to prevent people from using UGS, and were more common in certain areas of the city that were also hard-hit by COVID-19 in the beginning of the pandemic. To ensure that people can get health benefits from UGS during times of crisis, cities must eliminate barriers by providing equitable access to UGS, considering what amenities communities need from UGS, and provide consistent communication about public health policies.},

	abstract = {Social cohesion involves the interpersonal dynamics and sense of connection among people. Increased social cohesion can be associated with various physical and psychological health benefits. The presence of urban green spaces can encourage positive social interactions that cultivate social cohesion in ways that enhance health and well-being. Urban green spaces have also been linked to positive health behaviors and outcomes including increased physical activity and social engagement. Understanding the relationship between social cohesion and urban green space is important for informing holistic approaches to health. In this article, we discuss how positive interactions in urban green space can catalyze social cohesion, social capital and critical health-promoting behaviors that may enhance psychological health and well-being. We also summarize the strengths and limitations of previous studies and suggest directions for future research.},

Among these populations, one remains understudied although its numbers are growing: Chinese international students. Indeed, more and more Chinese students choose to go abroad for higher education but face specific challenges, often resulting in them experiencing high levels of stress and poor health. This study explores the link between Chinese international students’ use of local green spaces and the effect on their perceived stress and health. An online survey was created to collect data from 186 Chinese international students studying in Edinburgh, Scotland (UK). The data covered the participants’ reported health status and their perceived stress levels, the strategies they use when coping with stress, their awareness of the benefits of visiting green spaces as well as their self-reported use of and access to local green spaces. The findings show a significant correlation between access to and use of urban green spaces and the self-reported wellbeing indicators. Some of the barriers experienced by participants in visiting green spaces were also explored. By investigating the specific behaviors of this emerging and vulnerable population, this study expands the corpus of existing evidence for the role played by urban green spaces in supporting wellbeing. Some recommendations to support the health of this community using urban green spaces can therefore be proposed.},

We discuss difficulties in defining “nature” and reasons for the current expansion of the research field, and we assess available reviews. We then consider research on pathways between nature and health involving air quality, physical activity, social cohesion, and stress reduction. Finally, we discuss methodological issues and priorities for future research. The extant research does describe an array of benefits of contact with nature, and evidence regarding some benefits is strong; however, some findings indicate caution is needed in applying beliefs about those benefits, and substantial gaps in knowledge remain.

	abstract = {Urban green and blue spaces promote health by offering areas for physical activity, stress relief, and social interaction, which may be considered as cultural ecosystem services. They also provide a number of regulating ecosystem services that can be regarded as nature-based solutions to mitigate impacts from urbanization-induced challenges. Urban trees and other vegetation provide cooling through shade and evapotranspiration, which reduce the impact of the urban heat island on hot summer days. Urban vegetation may improve air quality by removing air pollutants. Open areas in cities, such as parks, gardens, playgrounds and cemeteries, are unsealed spaces that also improve infiltration during extreme precipitation events providing water regulating functions. All these services have the potential to improve the health of urban residents, particularly of specific vulnerable groups such as children and the elderly. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the current state of evidence on the relationship between the health of children and the elderly and urban green and blue spaces that can account as nature-based solutions to urbanization-induced challenges. We discuss potential confounding factors and refer to the different green space metrics used to identify associations to health. From the results, we cannot conclude on a universal protective health effect of urban green and blue spaces for children and the elderly. While the association trend is positive, the results remain inconclusive, context dependent and are partly overridden by socioeconomic confounders. However, the research area is consistently increasing, and we advance important prospects for future research on urban green and blue spaces in the face of global challenges such as urbanization.},

The recently coined concept, Nature-based solutions (NBS), is one such strategy referring to actions that are inspired by, supported by, or copied from nature, designed to address a range of environmental challenges. The objective with this article is to evaluate the evidence on public health benefits of exposure to natural environments and explore how this knowledge could be framed within the NBS concept. We conducted a systematic review of reviews following established methodology, including keyword search in several databases, predefined inclusion criteria, and a data extraction in accordance with the PICOS structure. We reviewed literature on associations between public health and natural environments in relation to pathways – sociobehavioural/cultural ecosystem services (e.g. stress and physical activity) and regulating ecosystem services (e.g. heat reduction) – or defined health outcomes (e.g. cardiovascular mortality). The results show that there is strong evidence for improved affect as well as on heat reduction from urban natural environments. These conditions may mediate the effect seen on cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related mortality by exposure to natural environments. By also reviewing existing literature on NBS and health, we phrase the results within the NBS context, providing guidelines on how public health and well-being could be integrated into implementation of NBS for resilient and liveable urban landscapes and health in a changing climate.},

Benefits and challenges to reflexivity under three types of researcher’s position are discussed and illustrated by means of case examples: (1) reflexivity when researcher shares the experience of study participants, (2) reflexivity when researcher moves from the position of an outsider to the position of an insider in the course of the study, and (3) reflexivity when researcher has no personal familiarity or experience with what is being studied. Strategies are offered for harvesting the benefits of researcher’s familiarity with the subject and for curbing its potentially negative effects. Directions for future research are suggested.},

The method aims to obtain data from a purposely selected group of individuals rather than from a statistically representative sample of a broader population. Even though the application of this method in conservation research has been extensive, there are no critical assessment of the application of the technique. In addition, there are no readily available guidelines for conservation researchers. Here, we reviewed the applications of focus group discussion within biodiversity and conservation research between 1996 and April 2017. We begin with a brief explanation of the technique for first-time users. We then discuss in detail the empirical applications of this technique in conservation based on a structured literature review (using Scopus). The screening process resulted in 170 articles, the majority of which (67\%, n = 114,) were published between 2011 and 2017. Rarely was the method used as a stand-alone technique. The number of participants per focus group (where reported) ranged from 3 to 21 participants with a median of 10 participants. There were seven (median) focus group meetings per study. Focus group discussion sessions lasted for 90 (median) minutes. Four main themes emerged from the review: understanding of people's perspectives regarding conservation (32\%), followed by the assessment of conservation and livelihoods practices (21\%), examination of challenges and impacts of resource management interventions (19\%) and documenting the value of indigenous knowledge systems (16\%). Most of the studies were in Africa (n = 76), followed by Asia (n = 44), and Europe (n = 30). We noted serious gaps in the reporting of the methodological details in the reviewed papers. More than half of the studies (n = 101) did not report the sample size and group size (n = 93), whereas 54 studies did not mention the number of focus group discussion sessions while reporting results. Rarely have the studies provided any information on the rationale for choosing the technique. We have provided guidelines to improve the standard of reporting and future application of the technique for conservation.},

We applied social network analysis to map the collaboration network among individuals involved in tourism activities (n = 124) in a coastal community in Brazil. Community groups were defined by gender, age, birthplace, education level, participation in tourism associations, income-generating activity, tourism occupation, and years of experience in CBT. The network was highly connected, while the collaboration patterns among groups exhibit a modular structure with features of both horizontality and leadership. We discuss how this balanced collaborative structure can contribute to community development in accordance with the core principles of CBT.},

However, CBT has been strongly criticized with respect to low economic impact in terms of jobs and income, the result of small-scale interventions, its low life expectancy after external funding ends, the monopolisation of benefits by local elites, or the lack of business skills to make it operational. This article explores the viability of the CBT model to support socio-economic development and poverty alleviation via a Nicaraguan case study. The characteristics and effects of different modes of organising community tourism were examined, based on an impact assessment and lifecycle analysis of the CBT Nicaraguan Network. The results showed how traditional top-down CBT, created and fully funded by external organisations, reflected the general criticisms of the approach, while bottom-up CBT, borne as a result of a local initiative, demonstrated longer life expectancy, faster growth, and more positive impacts on the local economy. The findings suggest a shift is required in the attention of donors and policy-makers towards redistribution policies that strengthen the skills, resources, and conditions of micro, community-based and family entrepreneurship, together with a stronger orientation towards the domestic markets.},

	abstract = {The issue of sustainable tourism is often discussed in terms of the balance between economic and environmental concerns. It is well known that many, if not all, economic activities have an impact on the environment and that this has a feedback effect on the economy itself. This is especially so in the case of tourism which utilises the environment as a resource. Tourism depends to a very large extent on an milieu which is pleasant and attractive to tourists, and negative environmental impacts caused by tourism itself, may therefore have the effect of “soiling one’s own nest” in the long run. Sustainable tourism may be defined as “tourism which is developed and maintained in such a manner and scale that it remains viable in the long run and does not degrade the environment in which it exists to such an extent that it prohibits the successful development of other activities”. Although the term “sustainable tourism” will not feature frequently in this paper, it was written with this definition in mind. The paper looks at the issue from the point of view of a small island developing state (SIDS),namely Malta. In many SIDS environmental degradation caused by tourism activities is commonplace. However many SIDS cannot substitute this form of economic activity with other, more environmentally-friendly activities, without great economic hardship. The paper therefore argues that preemptive and corrective measures are called for in order to reach an optimal solution between the evils of environmental degradation and the benefits of economic growth and development. The paper is divided in six sections. Following this introduction, the dependence of SIDS on tourism is briefly described. Section 3 assesses the economic impact of tourism on the Maltese economy, while section 4 deals with environmental impact of tourism on the same islands. Some preemptive and corrective measures for the promotion of sustainable tourism are suggested in section 5. Section 6 concludes the paper with the optimistic note that tourism itself is sharpening our awareness of the evils of environmental degradation, and this could be conducive towards the adoption of sustainable tourism policies and measures.},

	abstract = {In data analysis the qualitative researcher seeks to produce a convincing explanation of the phenomena under investigation. Data analysis is an iterative process and requires reflection and interpretation on the researcher’s part on several levels. Interpretation suggests that there are no clear rules and that the researcher’s judgment, intuition and ability to highlight issues play an important part in the process. As a result, the issue as to how to analyse qualitative evidence is an area often poorly understood by researchers new to the interpretivist paradigm. The complexity of the data analysis process is increased due to the volume of evidence collected as part of a qualitative research study. The role of Computer Aided Qualitative Data Analysis Software (CAQDAS) in supporting this data analysis process is examined in this paper. It explores how CAQDAS can be used in facilitating the management of an extensive qualitative evidence base. CAQDAS enables researchers to manage qualitative data that would prove onerous through manual “pen and paper” methods. The paper examines the author’s use of the CAQDAS package N‑vivo in managing approximately 400 pages of single spaced interview transcripts resultant from a study on the evaluation of a new student ICT administrative system implementation in the Irish Institute of Technology (IoT) sector. This was an extensive empirical research study conducted across several case study sites and involved 49 informants and multiple sources of case study evidence. The objective was to develop a coherent cross‑case primary narrative of the system’s implementation from the evidence collected, reduce this to a set of key findings and ultimately develop a theoretical conjecture that provided fresh insights into the ICT investment evaluation process. The N‑vivo package served primarily as a support tool in managing the interview transcripts; in reflecting on the emerging themes; and in interpreting the body of evidence. It facilitated the identification of key points, the coding of key concepts that emerged from the body of evidence, and comparison between these concepts. It supported the later reclassification of concepts into a series of categories and sub categories; this helped to organise related concepts in relation to the overall research and facilitated greater understanding of the body of evidence. It supported the creation of memos to clarify emerging concepts and the categorisation of interview material to facilitate cross‑case analysis. Further, it facilitated analysis through for example relationship and model exploration. These features of N‑vivo played a vital role in producing a series of narrative accounts and ultimately the distillation of a new theoretical conjecture.},

Within both lie diverse definitions, principles, criteria, critical success factors and benefits sought or outcomes desired, advocated by different stakeholders ranging from quasi-governmental and non-profit organizations to public-private sector and academic interests. This poses significant challenges to those interested in theory building, research and practice in the sustainable development and management of tourism. The paper builds on a previous article published in Sustainability by presenting an integrated framework based on a comprehensive, in-depth review and analysis of the tourism-related literature. The study reveals not just common ground and differences that might be anticipated, but also important sustainability dimensions that are lagging or require much greater attention, such as equity, justice, ethical and governance issues. A preliminary framework of “sustainable community-based tourism” (SCBT) is forwarded that attempts to bridge the disparate literature on ST and CBT. Critical directions forward are offered to progress research and sustainability-oriented practices towards more effective development and management of tourism in the 21st century.},

The evolution and development of CBT projects can follow different trajectories. This conceptual paper's main contribution is the formulation of a comprehensive model of the development of CBT. The model suggests that CBT projects can be initiated from within and outside the community by the private, public and non-governmental sectors or a combination of these using a to-pdown or bottom-up approach. It also posits that CBT projects can take a formal or informal character depending on the conditions leading to their initiation. The paper highlights the benefits and constraints to the scaling up or down of operations linked to informality. It supports further research in analyzing the various aspects associated with the shift from formality to the informality of CBT projects and vice versa and the relationship with CBT development and holistic community development.},

Particularly, CBT is promoted for community empowerment by tourism planners, researchers and practitioners alike. Drawing on a case study of the Chobe Enclave Conservation Trust (CECT) in Botswana, this chapter demonstrates that the adoption of CBT under the rubric of community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) may not always bring the desired outcomes. More specifically, the study demonstrates that operational, structural and cultural limits impede community participation in CBT development projects. These findings suggest that limited performance of CBT and conservation endeavors may be explained by the lack of consideration and incorporation of such limits in CBRNM initiatives. Nevertheless, while CECT may be perceived as having attained limited community empowerment success, the case study offers a positive example of how the government’s approach to natural resource management is evolving. The chapter is organized into three parts. First, an overview of the discourse around CBT is presented, highlighting the importance of community empowerment in CBT. Second, drawing on the case of Botswana, CBT’s organizational structure is discussed in terms of actors, roles and interests. Finally, the outcomes and effects of CBT are highlighted.},

Moreover, both destinations appeared to cope with their challenges through cooperative community efforts supported by non-governmental agencies.},

	abstract = {There has been considerable recent interest in methods of determining sample size for qualitative research a priori, rather than through an adaptive approach such as saturation. Extending previous literature in this area, we identify four distinct approaches to determining sample size in this way: rules of thumb, conceptual models, numerical guidelines derived from empirical studies, and statistical formulae. Through critical discussion of these approaches, we argue that each embodies one or more questionable philosophical or methodological assumptions, namely: a naïve realist ontology; a focus on themes as enumerable ‘instances’, rather than in more conceptual terms; an incompatibility with an inductive approach to analysis; inappropriate statistical assumptions in the use of formulae; and an unwarranted assumption of generality across qualitative methods. We conclude that, whilst meeting certain practical demands, determining qualitative sample size a priori is an inherently problematic approach, especially in more interpretive models of qualitative research.},

Convenience Sampling and Purposive Sampling are Nonprobability Sampling Techniques that a researcher uses to choose a sample of subjects/units from a population. Although, Nonprobability sampling has a lot of limitations due to the subjective nature in choosing the sample and thus it is not good representative of the population, but it is useful especially when randomization is impossible like when the population is very large. It can be useful when the researcher has limited resources, time and workforce. It can also be used when the research does not aim to generate results that will be used to create generalizations pertaining to the entire population. Therefore, there is a need to use nonprobability sampling techniques. The aim of this study is to compare among the two nonrandom sampling techniques in order to know whether one technique is better or useful than the other. Different articles were reviewed to compare between Convenience Sampling and Purposive Sampling and it is concluded that the choice of the techniques (Convenience Sampling and Purposive Sampling) depends on the nature and type of the research.},

	abstract = {Pacific Islanders have engaged in transnational practices since their first settlement of the many islands in the region. As they moved beyond the Pacific and settled in nations such as New Zealand, the U.S. and Australia these practices intensified and over time have profoundly shaped both home and diasporic communities. This edited volume begins with a detailed account of this history and the key issues in Pacific migration and transnationalism today. The papers that follow present a range of case studies that maintain this focus on both historical and contemporary perspectives. Each of the contributors goes beyond a narrowly economic focus to present the human face of migration and transnationalism; exploring questions of cultural values and identity, transformations in kinship, intergenerational change and the impact on home communities.

Pacific migration and transnationalism are addressed in this volume in the context of increasing globalisation and growing concerns about the future social, political and economic security of the Pacific region. As the case studies presented here show, the future of the Pacific depends in many ways on the ties diasporic Islanders maintain with their homelands.},

Accelerated migration of doctors and nurses from the Pacific island states of Fiji, Samoa and Tonga to the Pacific periphery is part of the globalization of health care. The findings from a recent survey of 251 doctors and nurses from the three island countries are reported here. Key determinants of both present migration status and future migration intentions were analyzed using econometric methods. Nurses’ and doctors’ propensities to migrate are influenced by both income and non-income factors, including ownership of businesses and houses. Migrants also tend to have more close relatives overseas, to have trained there, and so experienced superior working conditions. Migration propensities vary between countries, and between nurses and doctors within countries. Tongan nurses have a higher propensity to migrate, mainly because of greater relative earnings differentials, but are also more likely to return home. The role of kinship ties, relative income differentials and working conditions is evident in other developing country contexts. Remittances and return migration, alongside business investment, bring some benefits to compensate for the skill drain. National development policies should focus on encouraging return migration, alongside retention and recruitment, but are unlikely to prevent out migration.},

Through invoking discourses including these terms, Pacific Islanders both consciously draw on “panethnicity” and subconsciously strengthen and support their localized identities. In this way, Pacific Islanders blur the ethno-cultural and sociopolitical boundaries that traditionally separate groups with connections across a diverse range of countries. Indeed, diasporic settings give rise to transnationalist sentiment and actions and serve to strengthen panethnic identity. Using insider and auto-anthropology and ethnographic research techniques, I draw on my experiences as an Australian of Pacific Islander descent and use examples drawn from my involvement in formalized community groups, cultural events, and social functions. In doing so, I argue that the expression of Islander and Pacific Islander identity is entwined with ideas about “race,” place, stereotypes, and behavior that highlight the dynamic ethnogenesis of this group.},

	abstract = {Rugby is a sport that has given Fiji international recognition. The professionalisation of rugby has led to a growing number of elite players emigrating from Fiji ? often temporarily but sometimes permanently ? to metropolitan countries, with an estimated 450 athletes currently involved in foreign competitions. Whilst Fijians have a long history of migration to metropolitan societies, the recent global dispersion of rugby players has added new dimensions and complexities. This article intends to shed light upon this migratory phenomenon by exploring what it means for these Fijians to ply their trade in foreign leagues. Based on semi-structured interviews, the article examines the experiences of Fijian players who are currently or have previously been contracted by metropolitan rugby clubs and what these experiences mean to them regarding their sense of collective identity and pride, especially in the context of politico-economic disparities between Fiji and the host countries. In doing so, particular attention is paid to the voices and agency of those athletes who claim rugby migration as a space for counter-hegemonic collective self-expression. The article thus seeks to contribute to our understanding of the dynamics of the relationship between sports labour migration and collective local identification and resistance in an increasingly globalised world.},

Recently, a decline in the flows and an increase in return migration has been recorded. Literature has pointed out the existence of intense forces driving the emergence and expansion of this migration system. On the one side, (i) the Spanish economic growth, (ii) the arrival at young adult ages of small Spanish cohorts and the upwards mobility of Spanish females, and (iii) the immigration policy, specially favorable to the settlement of the Latin American population, are commonly quoted as some of the main pull factors. On the other side, push factors as (i) the relative income differentials and several economic shocks in Latin American economies, (ii) the demographic structure with the concentration of individuals in young-adult ages, (iii) a labor market offering few opportunities, (iv) the educational expansion of this region are named as factors that together with demographic potential to migration might have contributed to the development of mobility. This chapter analyzes the characteristics of the recent Latin American migration into Spain by countries of origin, and its bilateral determinants.},

Traditionally internationallabour migration is interpreted as a response tothe existing gaps in wage levels between countries. Butthe causes of migration should not be simplified to economic(usually wage/income) conditions. Even if economicfactors dominate in most countries migratoryprocesses, migration flows of each country are still influencedby the specific conditions or changes in localeconomy as well as country‘s historical perspective.Therefore migration determinants might be different inseparate countries, especially when talking about highlyskilledmigration. Perception of dominating factors in theLithuania’s highly-skilled migration is needed to obtainan objective evaluation of the “brain drain” problem andto solve it in proper ways.Empirical research gives us a general picture of aLithuanian highly-skilled migrant as being a young personwith higher skills who treats his or her socioeconomicstatus at rather satisfactory level before departureand is more inspired by pull effects.Factor analysis reveals us four main factors of interrelatedvariables in Lithuania’s highly-skilled migration:professional attraction in foreign countries, socioeconomicconditions having mostly push effects, stateacademic system and collaboration manifesting itselfboth in push and pull effects, and state macroeconomicconditions and governmental policy showing mostly migrants’discontent with the general situation of Lithuania.Other factors such as ecological conditions and familyreunification play much lesser role in this phenomenonof brain drain.The article consist of two parts: first part deals withthe concept of “brain drain” and its recent tendencies, inthe second part Lithuanian brain drain causes: push andpull factors and their manifestation between different migrantgroups are investigated.},

	abstract = {The welfare magnet hypothesis holds that immigrants are likely to relocate to regions with generous welfare benefits. Although this assumption has motivated extensive reforms to immigration policy and social programs, the empirical evidence remains contested. In this study, we assess detailed administrative records from Switzerland covering the full population of social assistance recipients between 2005 and 2015. By leveraging local variation in cash transfers and exogenous shocks to benefit levels, we identify how benefits shape within-country residential decisions. We find limited evidence that immigrants systematically move to localities with higher benefits. The lack of significant welfare migration within a context characterized by high variance in benefits and low barriers to movement suggests that the prevalence of this phenomenon may be overstated. These findings have important implications in the European setting, where subnational governments often possess discretion over welfare and parties frequently mobilize voters around the issue of “benefit tourism.”},

	abstract = {Which national characteristics do voluntary migrants prioritize when considering destinations? Although this question is salient for policymakers, extant studies face challenges when seeking to identify how various pull factors shape destination preferences. Surveys of migrants are typically conducted after they arrive, introducing selection bias and post-hoc reasoning. Moreover, desirable national characteristics tend to co-vary, implying that observed relationships with migration flows may be confounded. In this article, we identify the destination preferences of prospective migrants by drawing on a sample of 8,500 respondents from five sending states across the Middle East and North Africa. Prospective migrants completed a series of conjoint survey tasks in which they chose between two destinations with randomly varying characteristics. The results reveal a clear hierarchy of preferences, with prospective migrants placing the greatest priority on liberal democratic governance and employment prospects. The availability of welfare benefits acted as a secondary consideration, while geographic distance and co-ethnic stock did not strongly predict initial destination preferences. While the rank order of these considerations remains consistent across national samples, our results suggest that respondents from different economic and political backgrounds vary in how they navigate potential tradeoffs between national characteristics. These findings address post-arrival bias in extant studies by revealing prospective migrants? preferences before they interact with the opportunity structures that facilitate and restrict entry into desirable destinations.},

Design: Using a qualitative descriptive design, 27 participants took part in semistructured interviews. Findings/Results: Most participants perceived no changes in health and minor changes in well-being. Many maintained their well-being by adapting valued activities to their new circumstances. However, 5 participants were deeply burdened by life in Las Vegas or longing for Hawaii, and their well-being suffered. They tended to identify barriers to well-being rather than ways to foster it.

It is estimated that 1 in 10 residents of Hawaii visit Las Vegas at least once per year. Furthermore, nearly 80\% of those visitors choose to stay at The California Hotel (nicknamed “The Cal”), a property dating to the 1960s and located downtown, away from the mega-resorts of “The Strip”. While travel magazines and news outlets such as the New York Times have explained this phenomenon in racially reductionist terms, such as the well-known affinity of Asians for gambling, we argue that a more compelling explanation of the contemporary Hawaiian infatuation with travel to Las Vegas can be found in a deeper understanding of the environment created at The Cal. From the organization and décor of the gaming space, to the restaurant offerings and banquet rooms, The Cal materializes an imaginary of the multicultural Hawaiian present, unburdened by the inconvenient truths of either the real past or the real present.},

Findings reveal that migration to the mainland results in educational, occupational and economic gains in the U.S., which also help return migrants re-enter Island labor markets. U.S. settlement brings its own set of struggles. Puerto Ricans see themselves as members of transnational families, yet the struggles of leading dual lives result in settlement decisions that reflect desires to live locally with roots in one place instead of feeling split between the two. Experiences with U.S. racism complicate these decisions, given Puerto Ricans' struggles with racial identity and exclusion in spite of their economic, occupational, and residential integration into mainland society. This study illustrates the conditions under which various patterns of attachments to place-or emotional anchoring-develop, and how these feelings impact future Puerto Rican settlement.},

The underlying assumption is that there is a tendency toward equilibrium among geographic areas that are unequal in terms of factors such as labor supply, skills and level of development. Migration is seen as an equalizing process since it redistributes labor from areas of large supply to areas of large demand. In this context, both the sending and the receiving society benefit from the reallocation of labor.

                   It follows from this interpretation that migration is the result of a lack of economic development in the sending society.},

The purpose of this research is to examine the individual and combined effects of two forms of social capital, bonding and bridging, on community action in rural towns. Findings indicate that both bridging and bonding social capital significantly predict community action. In addition, an interaction is found that suggests that one form can make up for weaknesses in the other in communities in which both are not strong.},

	abstract = {This paper reports a literature review on the topic of ethical issues in in-depth interviews. The review returned three types of article: general discussion, issues in particular studies, and studies of interview-based research ethics. Whilst many of the issues discussed in these articles are generic to research ethics, such as confidentiality, they often had particular manifestations in this type of research. For example, privacy was a significant problem as interviews sometimes probe unexpected areas. For similar reasons, it is difficult to give full information of the nature of a particular interview at the outset, hence informed consent is problematic. Where a pair is interviewed (such as carer and cared-for) there are major difficulties in maintaining confidentiality and protecting privacy. The potential for interviews to harm participants emotionally is noted in some papers, although this is often set against potential therapeutic benefit. As well as these generic issues, there are some ethical issues fairly specific to in-depth interviews. The problem of dual role is noted in many papers. It can take many forms: an interviewer might be nurse and researcher, scientist and counsellor, or reporter and evangelist. There are other specific issues such as taking sides in an interview, and protecting vulnerable groups. Little specific study of the ethics of in-depth interviews has taken place. However, that which has shows some important findings. For example, one study shows participants are not averse to discussing painful issues provided they feel the study is worthwhile. Some papers make recommendations for researchers. One such is that they should consider using a model of continuous (or process) consent rather than viewing consent as occurring once, at signature, prior to the interview. However, there is a need for further study of this area, both philosophical and empirical.},

	abstract = {This article examines the distribution of parks in Baltimore, Maryland, as an environmental justice issue. In addition to established methods for measuring distribution of and access to parks, we employ a novel park service area approach that uses Thiessen polygons and dasymetric reapportioning of census data to measure potential park congestion as an equity outcome measure. We find that a higher proportion of African Americans have access to parks within walking distance, defined as 400 meters or less, than whites, but whites have access to more acreage of parks within walking distance than blacks. A needs-based assessment shows that areas with the highest need have the best access to parks but also have access to less acreage of parks compared to low-need areas. Park service areas that are predominantly black have higher park congestion than areas that are predominantly white, although differences are less apparent at the city level than at the metropolitan level. Following Iris Young and others, we argue that conceptions of justice must move beyond distributive justice and address the social and institutional mechanisms that generate inequities. For Baltimore, we examine how segregation ordinances, racial covenants, improvement associations, the Home Owners Loan Corporation, and the Parks and Recreation Board created separate black spaces historically underserved with parks. These mechanisms ultimately fueled middle-class flight and suburbanization and black inheritance of much of Baltimore's space, including its parks. If justice demands just distribution justly achieved, the present-day pattern of parks in Baltimore should be interpreted as environmental injustice.},

	abstract = {Green space accessibility is widely acknowledged as a crucial aspect of a livable environment and human well-being. Whether green space accessibility is equitable among communities is increasingly considered as an issue of environmental justice. Therefore, this study focuses on the possible environmental inequality of green space accessibility that can be found among residential communities in the context of Chinese booming housing market. The case study of Shanghai, China was conducted with the use of big data. A real-time navigation route measurement based on Amap application programming interface (AAPI) was developed to calculate green space accessibility, and housing price was used to indicate dwellers’ socioeconomic status. Bivariate Moran’s I, multiple regression, and spatial lag regression were adopted to explore inequality of green space accessibility among residential communities. The results reveal a spatial inequality of green space accessibility between communities in central portion of the city and those in peri-urban areas. We further found a spatial mismatch between green space accessibility and housing price. Environmental inequality is evident within the inner and middle ring road wherein wealthier communities benefit more from green space accessibility than disadvantaged communities. We attribute these findings to spatial restructuring and green gentrification process in Shanghai. The findings can inform planners and policymakers to determine where and how to implement greening strategies and to gain awareness to prevent environmental inequality.},

	abstract = {An increasing number of studies have sought to identify disparities or inequalities in the distribution of urban parks and green spaces. Results of these analyses have diverged considerably depending on the method used to assess accessibility. In this article, we revisit an increasingly popular technique, the two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method, and modify it to better align with the ways in which parks are planned and intended to be used. In this respect, we develop a Variable-width Floating Catchment Area (VFCA) method that models park attractiveness as a function of its size and number of amenities. We further compare accessibility according to four modes of transportation: bicycling, driving, public transit, and walking. A case study on access to public parks in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, the U.S. is performed. In general, walking access to parks is found to be low throughout the county, access to larger regional parks is greatest for outlying suburban areas, and center city residents have access to a greater number of park amenities. Study results are compared to those obtained when using the original 2SFCA and indicate important differences in spatial accessibility patterns. Consequently, caution must be adopted when choosing a spatial access model and interpreting the resulting spatial patterns of accessibility. The parameters of the VFCA can easily be set to different values, making it a tool for scenario analyses. This study further improves our understanding regarding accessibility to public parks, which can help develop effective planning strategies.},

However, studies are lacking the consideration of the demand and use of UGS by different population groups and connecting UGS with social infrastructure. In an era of worldwide urbanization and ageing, this European study sheds light on the role of UGS for care facilities for elderly. 126 care facilities from 17 cities in Austria, Germany, Norway, Poland, Romania and Slovenia took part in an online survey. Administrations of care facilities gave insights on the (1) importance of gardens related to care facilities for the quality of life for the seniors, (2) importance of UGS outside of care facilities for the quality of life for the seniors and (3) the consideration of natural and age-friendly designs and management of ecosystem disservices of UGS. The results emphasize not only the importance of UGS for the quality of life of seniors residing in care facilities, but also for the staff and visitors. UGS contribute to physical activities, recreation, and social interactions. The study found that in particular facilities with an own garden are highly aware of the benefits UGS provide. The study holds important lessons for UGS planning, management and design not only to focus on the quantitative supply of UGS, but also to consider age-sensitive amenities in and access to UGS of high quality for seniors.},

	abstract = {The Autonomous Region of Bougainville, Papua New Guinea, conducted an independence referendum in 2019, which resulted in the region seeking a pathway to complete independence. One of the requirements in establishing independence is ensuring “good governance,” an important facet of which is establishing a stable and adequate food supply. This is framed globally as achieving Sustainable Development Goal Two (SDG \#2) to end hunger and malnutrition. This article seeks to assess the measures that government and major donors have taken to implement SDG \#2 in Bougainville using a pressure-state-response framework and desktop-based risk assessment to identify areas for further work. The investigation aims to identify effective policy focus areas in order to better implement SDG \#2, namely, prioritising civil conflict avoidance, facilitating adaptation planning for climate regime shifts, and ensuring sustainable agricultural intensity and fisheries extraction. Based on these, recommendations for good governance include sustainable and equitable long-term interventions that reduce the risk of political disturbance and environmental degradation. As a result of engaging in this case, readers will be able to apply similar methodologies to inform development decisions in postconflict contexts. Bougainville faces similar challenges to many Pacific islands, including the impacts from climate change, food insecurity, conflict, population growth, and changing land tenure. This case can be extrapolated to these greater contexts.},

	abstract = {Background
Bougainville, an autonomous region of Papua New Guinea (PNG) is slowly improving services and infrastructure destroyed 20 years ago during the ten year civil war. However, the region still faces significant constraints to economic growth and human development and remains under-developed compared to PNG and close Pacific neighbours. PNG's 2017 Human Development Category (HDC) was one of the lowest at 0.544. The Bougainville Strategic Development Plan 2018–2022 noted significant gaps in health services and infrastructure, had inadequate water and waste disposal and experienced weak markets and cocoa quality. This research examines domestic conditions and the extent to which they impact on livelihoods.
Method
A cross-sectional livelihood survey was administered to cocoa growing households in 33 Village Assemblies (VAs) with 11 VAs in each of the three regions.
Results
Data was collected from 5172 individuals. A significant majority of households reported multiple health issues, rudimentary housing, unimproved sanitation and unimproved water. Over two-thirds of cocoa growers did not sell any cocoa bags in 2014–2016 resulting in low incomes and greater food insecurity compared to families selling cocoa. Families that produced no saleable cocoa were more likely to have rudimentary housing, unimproved toilet facilities and unsafe water, factors that increase the likelihood of chronic disease and exacerbate malnutrition and poor labour productivity.
Conclusion
This study provides key information about the health and livelihood status of cocoa growers in Bougainville. If productivity is to increase, farmer health needs to improve including improving water and sanitation practices and diets. Building a responsive health system for the community is a challenge when a majority of the population live in small villages with difficult access to health centres. Establishing and integrating outreach village health clinics will enable health care to be more accessible to these remote communities.},

	abstract = {Although much has changed for Australia in the international arena in the aftermath of the Bali bombings and the war in Iraq, its relations with Papua New Guinea PNG remain a constant and important part of its foreign policy. The Howard government has frequently been criticized as paying little attention to the island countries in Oceania, but recent events have resulted in a shift of focus, which has brought with it a consequent and ironic wave of criticism. With the exception of a hiatus due to Japanese occupation during World War II, Australia was PNG s administering authority under League of Nations and later United Nations UN mandates until the granting of internal self-government in 1973 and full independence in 1975. Like many other decolonization experiences in Oceania, much of the impetus toward independence was brought from the top-down, with Australia responding more to international opinion for decolonization. While grassroots and other social movements for independence did exist in PNG, they were not the strongest reason for independence. There were, in fact, some segments of the population that hoped for an even closer connection with Australia. This absence of a strong indigenous decolonization movement is often cited as a factor in the relatively weak sense of nationhood within PNG, and the disparate population some 700 distinct languages within the state has never experienced a catalyzing event to coalesce as a nation. With independence, PNG adopted a Westminster parliamentary form of government, though its adoption in a political culture that has more to do with personal relationships than party philosophies has been highly problematic. Electoral politics in PNG have been less about party identity and cohesion and more about personalities and personal reward. Electoral violence has not been uncommon, and political parties are numerous, practically insuring government by coalition.},

The rentier state logic holds that the main political–economic impacts of resource dependence rest on how the state handles windfall resource rents. I differentiate how countries experience the resource curse by disaggregating the rentier effect into how governments generate and distribute resource rents. A simple typology of variation in rentier state experiences explains how the overall credibility of intertemporal commitment and degree of political inclusiveness in a country determine its distinct experience of the resource curse. Four brief country cases—comparing the micro political economy of natural resource governance in Laos, Papua New Guinea, Mongolia, and Timor-Leste—illustrate how intertemporal credibility and political inclusiveness affect patterns of resource rent generation and rent distribution. Different countries experience the resource curse in different ways, with implications for policy attempts at mitigation.},

Cyprus, this time however, it is not the case. This time, the discussions are centered on
Cyprus’ potential application to NATO’s Partnership for Peace (PfP). Even during the
latest NATO submit in Lisbon of November, the issue of Cyprus was of large concern.78
Proponents of Cyprus’ application to the PfP see it a necessary step in Cyprus’ EU
integration plan and more specifically, integration within the European Security and
Defence Policy (ESDP) and the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). While
opponents see Cyprus’ application to the PfP as a move towards continued
militarization and a deviation from its long-standing policy of non-alignment. Thus,
this article will explore some of the possible scenarios relating to Cyprus’ membership
in NATO’s PfP analyze their outcomes and deduce whether joining the PfP will be
beneficial or harmful to Cyprus, the EU and NATO.},

Civilian Labor Force includes all persons in the civilian noninstitutional population ages 16 and older classified as either employed or unemployed.

Employed persons are all persons who, during the reference week (the week including the 12th day of the month), (a) did any work as paid employees, worked in their own business or profession or on their own farm, or worked 15 hours or more as unpaid workers in an enterprise operated by a member of their family, or (b) were not working but who had jobs from which they were temporarily absent because of vacation, illness, bad weather, childcare problems, maternity or paternity leave, labor-management dispute, job training, or other family or personal reasons, whether or not they were paid for the time off or were seeking other jobs. Each employed person is counted only once, even if he or she holds more than one job.

Unemployed persons are all persons who had no employment during the reference week, were available for work, except for temporary illness, and had made specific efforts to find employment some time during the 4 week-period ending with the reference week. Persons who were waiting to be recalled to a job from which they had been laid off need not have been looking for work to be classified as unemployed.

The unemployment rate is the unemployed percent of the civilian labor force [100 times (unemployed/civilian labor force)].

	abstract = {With over 80 million people forcibly displaced worldwide, providing safe, healthy, and supportive places for refugees has become an imperative for national governments, aid organizations, and host communities. While much has been written about the needs of these displaced people, organizations and practitioners tend to focus on essential material needs, medical care, and food and water provisioning. Yet a growing body of evidence points to the potential role of social capital – the bonding, bridging, and linking social ties that connect us to one another – as a critical resource for these refugees. We have little data about social capital interventions at individual and community levels to assist with mental health for this vulnerable population, and even less methodical evidence about such interventions’ impact. This systematic review analyzes nearly 400 articles to find patterns in the literature on how social-capital-based interventions can improve the mental health of refugees. Within the studies of interventions that met our filtering criteria, the reinforcement or creation of social capital, especially bridging and linking types, serves as a crucial resource to help this vulnerable group. Specifically, our review showed that community and multilevel social capital interventions are key to curbing mental health symptoms among refugees. Given this scanty evidence base among a group so vulnerable to mental health problems, this review serves as an explicit invitation for researchers to further examine social capital interventions among refugees.},

	abstract = {Studies have shown that poverty and income are powerful predictors of homicide and violent crime. We hypothesized that the effect of the growing gap between the rich and poor is mediated through an undermining of social cohesion, or social capital, and that decreased social capital is in turn associated with increased firearm homicide and violent crime. Social capital was measured by the weighted responses to two items from the U.S. General Social Survey: the per capita density of membership in voluntary groups in each state; and the level of social trust, as gauged by the proportion of residents in each state who believed that “most people would take advantage of you if they got the chance”. Age-standardized firearm homicide rates for the years 1987–1991 and firearm robbery and assault incidence rates for years 1991–1994 were obtained for each of the 50 U.S. states. Income inequality was strongly correlated with firearm violent crime (firearm homicide, r=0.76) as well as the measures of social capital: per capita group membership (r=−0.40) and lack of social trust (r=0.73). In turn, both social trust (firearm homicide, r=0.83) and group membership (firearm homicide, r=−0.49) were associated with firearm violent crime. These relationships held when controlling for poverty and a proxy variable for access to firearms. The profound effects of income inequality and social capital, when controlling for other factors such as poverty and firearm availability, on firearm violent crime indicate that policies that address these broader, macro-social forces warrant serious consideration.},

	abstract = {Brain drain is a major issue for Small Island Developing States (SIDS). Econometric analysis confirms that smallness has a strong positive impact per se on emigration rates. On average, 50 \% of the high-skilled labour force in SIDS has left their country, and the brain drain exceeds 75 \% in a few cases. In this paper, we document this phenomenon and study the bi-directional links between brain drain and development. We show that these interdependencies can be the source of multiple equilibria and that small states are much more likely to be badly coordinated than other developing countries and settle in a bad equilibrium. The reason is that their elasticity of emigration to economic performance is larger. After calibration, we identify an important number of badly coordinated SIDS and quantify the economic costs of coordination failure. These costs may exceed 100 \% of the observed GDP per capita. Badly coordinated small states require appropriate development policies aimed at retaining or repatriating their high-skilled labour force.},

	abstract = {Low levels of social interaction across class lines have generated widespread concern1–4 and are associated with worse outcomes, such as lower rates of upward income mobility4–7. Here we analyse the determinants of cross-class interaction using data from Facebook, building on the analysis in our companion paper7. We show that about half of the social disconnection across socioeconomic lines—measured as the difference in the share of high-socioeconomic status (SES) friends between people with low and high SES—is explained by differences in exposure to people with high SES in groups such as schools and religious organizations. The other half is explained by friending bias—the tendency for people with low SES to befriend people with high SES at lower rates even conditional on exposure. Friending bias is shaped by the structure of the groups in which people interact. For example, friending bias is higher in larger and more diverse groups and lower in religious organizations than in schools and workplaces. Distinguishing exposure from friending bias is helpful for identifying interventions to increase cross-SES friendships (economic connectedness). Using fluctuations in the share of students with high SES across high school cohorts, we show that increases in high-SES exposure lead low-SES people to form more friendships with high-SES people in schools that exhibit low levels of friending bias. Thus, socioeconomic integration can increase economic connectedness in communities in which friending bias is low. By contrast, when friending bias is high, increasing cross-SES interactions among existing members may be necessary to increase economic connectedness. To support such efforts, we release privacy-protected statistics on economic connectedness, exposure and friending bias for each ZIP (postal) code, high school and college in the United States at https://www.socialcapital.org.},

However, efforts to understand what types of social capital matter for these outcomes have been hindered by a lack of social network data. Here, in the first of a pair of papers9, we use data on 21 billion friendships from Facebook to study social capital. We measure and analyse three types of social capital by ZIP (postal) code in the United States: (1) connectedness between different types of people, such as those with low versus high socioeconomic status (SES); (2) social cohesion, such as the extent of cliques in friendship networks; and (3) civic engagement, such as rates of volunteering.

	abstract = {Seasonal labour migration and ‘guest worker’ schemes are a common and growing phenomenon around the world. In 2008, the Australian government introduced the Pacific Seasonal Worker pilot scheme for workers from select Pacific Island nations to work in the horticultural industry in Australia. The scheme is the first guest worker scheme in the history of the Commonwealth. The visas entitle workers to reside in Australia for a maximum of seven months, with no provision for secondary visas for family members and no prospect of upgrading the visas to permanent residency. The introduction of the pilot scheme is indicative of a growing trend in the use of temporary labour migration in Australia, and raises the fundamental question of just what are the ethical limits of such schemes. The article addresses this question by considering whether it is consistent with liberal political values to deny long-term seasonal workers the opportunity to join the Australian community. It introduces Michael Walzer’s influential work on this question, and then proposes the liberal criteria of ‘freedom’ as the principle underpinning the state’s obligation to seasonal workers. The article draws on a distinction between freedom as non-interference and freedom as non-domination in Philip Pettit’s theory of republicanism, and uses the distinction to pose the question of whether the freedom of the migrant labourer can be assured through regulation of the employment relationship, or whether it can only be assured through removing the unequal status between alien workers and citizen employers. The article also considers the nature of work, and the vulnerability of migrant workers within the employment relationship. It argues that the problems which arise in the employment relationship between migrant workers and their employers, as they invariably do, are symptomatic of the exclusion of migrant workers from participation in the political life of the receiving state. The article concludes that there are problems with dissociating work in a state from membership of that state in the long term, and makes the case for providing the opportunity for guest workers to apply for permanent residence.},

In broad terms, islands may include oceanic landforms and landforms on continental shelves. Some islands are extremely isolated from continental influences; others are subject to strong continental influences. The focus of this work is on islands near metropolitan centres which are readily accessible and thus subject to various development pressures1 that may threaten ecological, social and economic well-being. In an era where the basic principles of sustainable development are now given, and the intrinsic value of place is acknowledged, for those who live on, govern or care for islands, such pressures are often understood (however partially) in terms of sustainability and in relation to their effects on what is known as sense of place.},

	abstract = {For several decades there has been extensive migration from the small island states of the South Pacific and the eastern Caribbean to metropolitan countries, resulting in absolute population decline in some states and new social, economic and political relationships between these island regions and distant worlds. Early research on the consequences for island development of return migration and remittances dwelt upon the unproductive nature of expenditures and the various problems return migration and remittances cause. Questioning this view, a new conceptualization of the influences of migration, circulation and remittances on recipient families, communities and societies in the island states of the South Pacific and the Caribbean is presented. Regional similarities and differences are recognized, yet commonalities of island microstates’ experiences emerge. Remittances are a very significant private transfer of capital and return migrants represent people endowed with human capital, capable of enriching the social and cultural capital stocks of their island communities. In both insular regions, the consolidation of transnational linkages emphasizes the significance of diaspora relations for migrant households at home and abroad and offers some prospects for sustainable development, beyond those offered solely by domestic economic opportunities. Depuis plusieurs décennies, une migration considérable s’est développée des petites îles états du Pacifique du sud et des Antilles de l’est vers les pays métropolitains. Le résultat est un déclin du nombre absolu de la population dans certains de ces états et de nouvelles relations sociales, économiques et politiques entre ces régions des îles et les mondes éloignés. Les premières recherches sur les conséquences pour le développement des îles de la migration de retour et des envois de fonds insistaient sur la nature improductive des dépenses et sur les différents problèmes causés par la migration de retour et les envois de fonds. Questionnant ce point de vue, nous présentons une nouvelle conception des influences de la migration, de la circulation et des envois de fonds sur les familles qui en bénéficient, sur les communautés et sur les sociétés des îles états du Pacifique du sud et des Antilles. Bien que les similarités et des différences régionales soient reconnues, des points communs dans les expériences des micro-états émergent. Les envois de fonds sont un tranfert privé de capital très significatif et les émigrants qui reviennent sont dotés de capital humain, capables d’enrichir le domaine social et culturel de leurs communautés des îles. Dans les deux régions insulaires, la consolidation des liens transnationaux démontre la signification des relations de la diaspora pour les familles migratrices chez elles et à l’étranger et offre des possibilités de développement durable au-delà de ceux offerts uniquement par les opportunités économiques intérieures.},

	abstract = {Since the mid-twentieth century, small islands have emerged as important tourist destinations, whether as island-states (Barbados, Fiji), island dependencies (Guadeloupe, Jersey) or state-islands (Okinawa, Cozumel). A longstanding core–periphery narrative holds that small islands are geographically and economically marginal entities fated to spawn homogeneous tourism monocultures within contexts of persistent external dependency. However, further investigation reveals several attendant and pervasive paradoxes which challenge this conventional thinking. This paper outlines these as the juxtaposition of (a) geographic peripherality and experiential core, (b) economic marginality and tourism centrality, (c) tourism monocultures and opportunistic innovation, (d) geopolitical dependency and optimal autonomy and (e) tourism homogeneity and cultural/ecological distinctiveness. A resultant ‘virtuous periphery syndrome’, the product of both necessity and endowment, positions small islands as sites of impressive resilience and innovation capable of providing peak experiences that support robust tourism sectors within contexts of balanced autonomy and cultural distinctiveness. Resolution-based dialectics allow the positive elements of both core and periphery to be identified and combined towards achieving the ideal of enlightened mass tourism.},

	title = {A {General} {Inductive} {Approach} for {Qualitative} {Data} {Analysis}},
	volume = {27},
	abstract = {An outline of a general inductive approach for qualitative data analysis is described and details provided about the assumptions and procedures used. The purposes for using an inductive approach are to (1) to condense extensive and varied raw text data into a brief, summary format; (2) to establish clear links between the research objectives and the summary findings derived from the raw data and (3) to develop of model or theory about the underlying structure of experiences or processes which are evident in the raw data. The inductive approach reflects frequently reported patterns used in qualitative data analysis. Most inductive studies report a model that has between three and eight main categories in the findings. The general inductive approach provides a convenient and efficient way of analysing qualitative data for many research purposes. The outcomes of analysis may be indistinguishable from those derived from a grounded theory approach. Many researchers are likely to find using a general inductive approach more straightforward than some of the other traditional approaches to qualitative data analysis. A general inductive approach for qualitative data analysis David R. Thomas, School of Population Health, University of Auckland, August 2003 2 A general inductive approach for qualitative data analysis There is a wide range of literature that documents the underlying assumptions and procedures associated with analysing qualitative data. Many of these are associated with specific approaches or traditions such as grounded theory (Strauss \& Corbin, 1990), phenomenology (e.g., van Manen, 1990), discourse analysis (e.g., Potter \& Wetherall, 1994) and narrative analysis (e.g., Leiblich, 1998). However some analytic approaches are "generic" and are not labelled within one of the specific traditions of qualitative research (e.g., Ezzy, 2002; Pope, Ziebland, \& Mays, 2000; Silverman, 2000). In working with researchers who adopt what has been described as a "critical realist" epistemology (Miles \& Huberman, 1994) the author has found that many researchers unfamiliar with any of the traditional approaches to qualitative analysis, wish to have a straightforward set of procedures to follow without having to learn the technical language or "jargon" associated with many of the traditional approaches. Often they find existing literature on qualitative data analysis too technical to understand and use. The present paper has evolved from the need to provide researchers analysing qualitative data with a brief, non-technical set of data analysis procedures. A considerable number of authors reporting analyses of qualitative data in journal articles (where space for methodological detail is often restricted) describe a strategy that can be labelled as a "general inductive approach." This strategy is evident in much qualitative data analysis (Bryman \& Burgess, 1994; Dey, 1993), often without an explicit label being given to the analysis strategy. The purpose of the present paper is to describe the key features evident in the general inductive approach and outline a set of procedures that can be used for the analysis of qualitative data. The inductive approach is a systematic procedure for analysing qualitative data where the analysis is guided by specific objectives.},

It is the most popular swimming area in the Hawaiian Islands and has been reported to have averaged between 2.8 and 3.5 million visitors a year between the 1980s and the 2010s, with visitors averaging between 3000-4000 a day and peaking around 10,000-13,000 per day. Concentrations of oxybenzone and other common UV filters were measured in subsurface water samples and in sands from the beach-shower areas in Hanauma Bay. Results demonstrate that beach showers also can be a source of sunscreen environmental contamination. Hydrodynamic modeling indicates that oxybenzone contamination within Hanauma Bay's waters could be retained between 14 and 50 h from a single release event period. Focusing on only oxybenzone, two different Hazard and Risk Assessment analyses were conducted to determine the danger of oxybenzone to Hanauma Bay's coral reef system. Results indicate that oxybenzone contamination poses a significant threat to the wildlife of Hanauma Bay. To recover Hanauma Bay's natural resources to a healthy condition and to satisfactorily conserve its coral reef and sea grass habitats, effective tourism management policies need to be implemented that mitigate the threat of sunscreen pollution.},

Unfortunately, some common UV filters are bioaccumulated in aquatic organisms and show a potential for estrogenic activity. The aim of the present study is to determine the presence of some UV filters in the coastal waters of six beaches around Gran Canaria Island as consequence of recreational seaside activities. Eight commonly used UV filters: benzophenone-3 (BP-3), octocrylene (OC), octyl-dimethyl-PABA (OD-PABA), ethylhexyl methoxy cinnamate (EHMC), homosalate (HMS), butyl methoxydibenzoyl methane (BMDBM), 4-methylbenzylidene camphor (4-MBC) and diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate (DHHB), were monitored and, with the exception of OD-PABA, all were detected in the samples collected. 99\% of the samples showed some UV filters and concentration levels reached up to 3316.7ng/L for BP-3. Environmental risk assessment (ERA) approach showed risk quotients (RQ) higher than 10, which means that there is a significant potential for adverse effects, for 4-MBC and EHMC for those samples with highest levels of UV filters.},

	abstract = {Estimation of the economic value of ecosystem services is particularly incipient in the marine realm, where numerous services still need to be evaluated. Seagrasses deliver essential services to humans. In this paper, we determined the economic value of Cymodocea nodosa seagrass meadows for local fisheries at the oceanic island of Gran Canaria (eastern Atlantic). Large-sized fishes, which constitute the fishable fraction, were seasonally sampled through 2011 by means of visual censuses at 12 seagrass-dominated sites. The total fish biomass was 907.6 kg (894.55 kg of commercially-targeted fishes). By using standard market prices, we estimated that the monetary value of this biomass averaged 866 € ha−1; at the island-scale, this value adds up to 606 239 €, when considering the area covered by C. nodosa. Small-sized fishes (mostly juveniles that replenish fisheries) were also seasonally sampled, through a seine net, at the same 12 seagrass-dominated sites. Eight nearshore fish species with commercial interest used seagrass meadows as ‘nursery grounds’. Estimates of secondary production revealed that this fish production monetarily averaged 95.75 € ha−1 y−1 when considering standard market prices; this value adds up to 67 030.30 € y−1 at the island-scale, when considering the area covered by C. nodosa. This study provides complementary assessments of the key economic contribution of seagrass meadows for coastal fisheries as both ‘fishing’ and ‘nursery’ grounds. This is a way to promote the social perception of the key role that seagrasses play on the coast and, therefore, the necessity of incorporating seagrasses into conservation legislative frameworks.},

Although primary productivity of leaf segments seemed to benefit from sunscreen addition, probably due to inorganic nutrients released, the rest of the biological parameters reflected possible impairments in the overall functioning of P. oceanica as a result of oxidative damages. Chlorophyll production and nitrogen fixation associated with old leaves were inhibited under high sunscreen concentrations, which concurred with elevated reactive oxygen species production, catalase activity and polyphenols content in the seagrass leaves. These results emphasize the importance of directing future investigations on determining which specific components of sunscreen products are likely threatening the wellbeing of critical species, such as P. oceanica.},

However, little is currently known about the sunscreen use patterns of beach-goers in Hawaii. To gain more information about the potential effectiveness of the ban, we surveyed beach-goers to better understand: the prevalence of oxybenzone and octinoxate in sunscreens, the proportion of sunscreens that are purchased in Hawaii and out of state, what factors go into people's selection of sunscreens, awareness of the harmful effects these chemicals, and willingness to switch to “reef-safe” sunscreen alternatives. Slightly over half of sunscreens were purchased in the state of Hawaii, meaning that almost half of sunscreens being used will not be subject to the chemical ban. Approximately 75\% of beach goers stated that they were aware of the harmful effects of some sunscreen chemicals, but nearly one-third still used sunscreens containing oxybenzone or octinoxate. While this study only documented the presence or absence of the two banned chemicals, the majority of sunscreens still contained other UV blocking chemicals or nano-sized mineral particles that are potentially detrimental to coral health. The majority of respondents stated that they would be willing to switch to reef safe sun protection alternatives, but this is hindered by respondents' lack of knowledge about which chemicals they should avoid. Clear and consistent “reef safe” labeling standards would enable individuals to make more informed sunscreen purchasing decisions.},

Five seagrass meadows were sampled in summer and winter of 1994–1995 and in winter and summer 2011. The decrease in C. nodosa correlated with a 3-fold increase in the biomass of the green rhizophytic algae Caulerpa prolifera (Forsskål) J.V. Lamoroux over the same time period, although this increase varied notably among meadows. We also documented a negative correlation between the biomass of C. nodosa and C. prolifera at the island-scale, sampling 16 meadows in 2011. Experimental evidence demonstrated that C. prolifera can cause significant negative impacts on C. nodosa: plots with total (100\%) removals of C. prolifera had ca. 2.5 more shoots and 3.5 times more biomass of C. nodosa, after 8 months, compared to plots with 50\% removals and untouched control plots. Interference by C. prolifera appears to partially explain the decay in the abundance of C. nodosa populations in Gran Canaria. This study, however, did not identify potential underlying processes and/or environmental alterations that may have facilitated the disappearance of C. nodosa.},

	abstract = {Seagrass meadows are deteriorating worldwide. However, numerous declines are still unreported, which avoid accurate evaluations of seagrass global trends. This is particularly relevant for the western African coast and nearby oceanic archipelagos in the eastern Atlantic. The seagrass Cymodocea nodosa is an ‘ecological engineer’ on shallow soft bottoms of the Canary Islands. A comparative decadal study was conducted in 21 C. nodosa seagrass meadows at Gran Canaria Island to compare the structure (shoot density, leaf length and cover) between 2003 and 2012. Overall, 11 meadows exhibited a severe regression, while 10 remained relatively stable. During this period, natural influences (sea surface temperature, Chlorophyll-a concentration and PAR light, as well as the number of storm episodes detaching seagrasses) had a low predictive power on temporal patterns in seagrass structure. In contrast, proximity from a range of human-mediated influences (e.g. the number of outfalls and ports) seem to be related to the loss of seagrass; the rate of seagrass erosion between 2003 and 2012 was significantly predicted by the number of human-mediated impacts around each meadow. This result highlights promoting management actions to conserve meadows of C. nodosa at the study region through efficient management of local impacts.},

	abstract = {The shoot density, leaf length and biomass of the seagrass Cymodocea nodosa (Ucria) Ascherson were found to severely decline in the last 17 years in the oceanic island of Gran Canaria (central Eastern Atlantic). Five seagrass meadows were sampled in summer and winter of 1994–1995 and in winter and summer 2011. The decrease in C. nodosa correlated with a 3-fold increase in the biomass of the green rhizophytic algae Caulerpa prolifera (Forsskål) J.V. Lamoroux over the same time period, although this increase varied notably among meadows. We also documented a negative correlation between the biomass of C. nodosa and C. prolifera at the island-scale, sampling 16 meadows in 2011. Experimental evidence demonstrated that C. prolifera can cause significant negative impacts on C. nodosa: plots with total (100\%) removals of C. prolifera had ca. 2.5 more shoots and 3.5 times more biomass of C. nodosa, after 8 months, compared to plots with 50\% removals and untouched control plots. Interference by C. prolifera appears to partially explain the decay in the abundance of C. nodosa populations in Gran Canaria. This study, however, did not identify potential underlying processes and/or environmental alterations that may have facilitated the disappearance of C. nodosa.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a dynamic model of international tourism demand to Canary Islands. The empirical analysis exploits the panel structure of the dataset (for the 15 most important countries of origin of tourists over the period 1992–2002) by a Generalized Method of Moments estimation of a dynamic model taking into account unobserved country-specific effects. The preferred model is the GMM-DIFF proposed by Arellano and Bond, however other models are also shown for comparison. A dynamic model where the lagged dependent variable is included as regressor is used to obtain short-run and long-run elasticities. Problems arising from the non-stationarity of data are dealt with by using a model in first differences. The estimated coefficient for the lagged depended variable is always significant and may reflect a high degree of consumer loyalty or an important effect of word of mouth in determining demand of international tourism. In brief, the results suggests that tourism demand to Canary Islands must be considered as a luxury good and is highly dependent on the evolution of relative prices and cost of travel between origin and destination country.},

The direct cellular damage inflicted by the ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun results in premature aging, DNA damage, and mutations that ultimately lead to skin cancer. Sunscreens are highly recommended to protect against UV radiation. However, little research has been conducted on the economic burden of sunscreen use. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the annual cost of sunscreen under both ideal and actual use conditions while stratifying for the sun protection factor (SPF) and by the name brand or equivalent store brand sunscreen. Pricing data was collected for sunscreens of SPF 30, 50, 70, and 100. For each type of sunscreen, the size and price of the container were recorded. Our results demonstrated that sunscreen prices increased with SPF but purchasing a generic sunscreen resulted in savings of 40\%-50\%. Our estimates reveal that sunscreens are affordable with annual expenditures ranging from \$30.21 to \$61.94, depending on brand, for SPF 50 sunscreens used with minimal application density for the average person.},

	abstract = {Background
The incidence of skin cancers is rapidly increasing in Western countries. One of the main sun-protection measures advocated is application of sunscreen. Some studies report a failure to comply with sunscreen application guidance. One explanation is their cost.
Objective
To evaluate the true cost of sunscreen in two situations: a 4-member family spending 1 week at the beach and a transplant patient respecting all the sun protection recommendations.
Methods
We performed an analysis of prices of sunscreens sold via Internet drugstores in Europe and North America. Standard sunscreen application recommendations were followed. We tested the recommended amount of sunscreen to be applied (ie, 2 mg/cm2).
Results
Six hundred seven sunscreens from 17 drugstores in 7 countries were evaluated. Median price of sunscreen was \$1.7 US per 10 grams. The price decreased with the size of the bottle. The median price for a family varied from \$178.2 per week to \$238.4 per week. The price decreased by 33\% if the family wore UV-protective T-shirts and by 41\% if large-volume bottles were used. The median price for a transplant patient varied from \$245.3 per year to \$292.3 per year.
Limitations
Anti-UVA activity and topical properties were not evaluated. We tested the recommended amount (2 mg/cm2) rather than the amount actually used (1 mg/cm2).
Conclusion
Under acute sun exposure conditions (a week at the beach), the cost of sun protection appears acceptable if sun protective clothing is worn and large-format bottles and low-cost sunscreens are used. Conversely, in a sun-sensitive population requiring year-round protection, the annual budget is relatively high and patients may require financial assistance to be compliant with sun protection guidelines.},

	abstract = {The present knowledge of the marine phanerogams of the Canary Islands is poorly documented. Earlier studies of the marine phytobenthos along the Canarian coasts provides little information on seagrass ecosystems and their distributional patterns. This contribution summarizes the available information about the three species reported for the islands: Cymodocea nodosa (Ucria) Ascherson, Halophila decipiens Ostenfeld and Zostera noltii Hornemann; and their distributional records is analized in relation with the main oceanographic and geomor- phological conditions. Cymodocea nodosa and Halophila decipiens are present in shallow subtidal areas on diverse mobile substrata, whereas Zostera noltii has been reported for intertidal communities in one eastern locality of Lanzarote Island, with historical records in Fuerteventura and Gran Canaria Islands. At present, the latter species is not found in any of the mentioned localities and probably its has disappeared due to anthropogenic activities (urban pollution, sediments disturbances). Most of the localities with seagrass communities are located in the eastern and southern coasts of the islands, always in sheltered areas, protected against Trade Winds. The vertical distribution of Cymodocea nodosa meadows ranges from (0.3) 2 to 35 m depth, whereas Halophila decipiens meadows are present between 6 to 40 m depth. /// El estudio de la \$vegetaci{\textbackslash}acute\{o\}n\$ marina en las Islas Canarias se ha ocupado vagamente de las \$faner{\textbackslash}acute\{o\}gamas\$ marinas.

Global warming, toxic waste, water and air pollution, acid rain, and shrinking energy supplies are frightening challenges that may threaten our future if we do not face up to them. Global Environmental Challenges provides important information and gives us hope about the environment. This book first helps us to grasp these difficulties, then shows us the choices we can make. How long to leave a light on, whether to take the car, the train, or bicycle to work, whether to recycle or throw away, whether to vote to curb continued suburban sprawl-all of these decisions can make a difference. This collection of some of the best essays and articles on the environment comes from a variety of sources, including journals, magazines, websites of ecological/conservation organizations, and other publications. Five major sections investigate the interaction of population growth, consumption, and environment; the emerging crisis in freshwater around the globe; global climate and atmosphere (including global warming); biodiversity loss; and the concept of sustainable development-using natural resources to place future human development on a sustainable path. The final section on sustainable development reveals how we can take action. As individuals, we can make a difference readily and easily without making huge personal sacrifices. As societies, we can work together in a global community of interest to sustain the earth. This valuable resource offers readers a better understanding of our environmental problems and presents solutions to improving the health of the planet.},

The challenge is to turn this recognition into incentives and institutions that will guide wise investments in natural capital, on a large scale. Advances are required on three key fronts, each featured here: the science of ecosystem production functions and service mapping; the design of appropriate finance, policy, and governance systems; and the art of implementing these in diverse biophysical and social contexts. Scientific understanding of ecosystem production functions is improving rapidly but remains a limiting factor in incorporating natural capital into decisions, via systems of national accounting and other mechanisms. Novel institutional structures are being established for a broad array of services and places, creating a need and opportunity for systematic assessment of their scope and limitations. Finally, it is clear that formal sharing of experience, and defining of priorities for future work, could greatly accelerate the rate of innovation and uptake of new approaches.},

	abstract = {Many ecological and evolutionary studies seek to explain patterns of shape variation and its covariation with other variables. Geometric morphometrics is often used for this purpose, where a set of shape variables are obtained from landmark coordinates following a Procrustes superimposition. We introduce geomorph: a software package for performing geometric morphometric shape analysis in the r statistical computing environment. Geomorph provides routines for all stages of landmark-based geometric morphometric analyses in two and three-dimensions. It is an open source package to read, manipulate, and digitize landmark data, generate shape variables via Procrustes analysis for points, curves and surfaces, perform statistical analyses of shape variation and covariation, and to provide graphical depictions of shapes and patterns of shape variation. An important contribution of geomorph is the ability to perform Procrustes superimposition on landmark points, as well as semilandmarks from curves and surfaces. A wide range of statistical methods germane to testing ecological and evolutionary hypotheses of shape variation are provided. These include standard multivariate methods such as principal components analysis, and approaches for multivariate regression and group comparison. Methods for more specialized analyses, such as for assessing shape allometry, comparing shape trajectories, examining morphological integration, and for assessing phylogenetic signal, are also included. Several functions are provided to graphically visualize results, including routines for examining variation in shape space, visualizing allometric trajectories, comparing specific shapes to one another and for plotting phylogenetic changes in morphospace. Finally, geomorph participates to make available advanced geometric morphometric analyses through the r statistical computing platform.},

	abstract = {ShapeR is an open source software package that runs on the R platform and is specifically designed to study otolith shape variation among fish populations. The package extends previously described software used for otolith shape analysis by allowing the user to automatically extract closed contour outlines from a large number of images, perform smoothing to eliminate pixel noise, choose from conducting either a Fourier or Wavelet transform to the outlines and visualize the mean shape. The output of the package are independent Fourier or Wavelet coefficients which can be directly imported into a wide range of statistical packages in R. The package might prove useful in studies of any two dimensional objects.},
